# About repository
     
Howdy, people!
This repository is aimed to help the Python beginners here.
So, Python is "hard as it looks", but trust me, it is damn easy once you get hold of it.
Every project made on Python is Python Powered.
     

# Resources and custom packages
So, download the files on the main branch and do not worry, Thonny is safe, no viruses. It is open-source here, on GitHub.
Install Python first, then extract VSCode zip file, use it as main editor, coz you can login to GitHub if you got an account here.
For the custom resources, like Tkinter, PyGame, etc, open your terminal of choice and run the command `pip`.
It must show some gibberish, but if it doesn't, then search how to get pip on Google.
If you got it and wanna install, you type `pip install __________` where the dash is your package, such as tkinter.


# Tutorials
Want tutorials? Then head to YouTube and search for DJ Oamen, CodeWithHarry or Tech With Tim.
Want to install or make a Python to Windows exe file?
This is for them.


# Executable builder for Windows
Go to Terminal and run `pip install pyinstaller`.
Then run `pyinstaller --onefile -w python_filename.py` where python_filename.py is your project filename. It works only on Tkinter or Turtle or PyGame or all GUI types.
